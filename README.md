      └── The following is a critical user journey for ClearScore customers:
             Test 1
                Using your tooling of choice, visit the ClearScore website & write tests to check that:
                • the “We use cookies” notification is present
                • the “We use cookies” notification can be dismissed
                • the “We use cookies” notification does not reappear after being dismissed
                • the appropriate cookie(s) are set
                
             Test 3
                Using your FE framework from Test 1, provide tests to address the following acceptance criteria:
                • an email address is required to sign up
                • a valid email address must be provided to sign up
                • when a valid email address is provided, and Sign up is clicked, the user is taken to step 1 of registration
             

- I have decided to include an aditional test called (Test 3.1) focused on registration functionality. 

Additional Questions:
1. How would you integrate the tests you have written into a continuous integration environment? 
   - I haved used POM (Project Object Model) to write these tests which will give the tests a better way of organisation when CI is needed. 🧹

3. How would you approach running the same tests across mobile devices and different browsers? 
   - Cypress UI Version 8.5.0 has a button on the top right to address running in different browsers. 🖥
   - Ranorex Studio supports iOS and Android operating systems. It offers testing mobile native as well as web applications. ✅

4. If you had more time available, are there any improvements that you would make to the code provided?
   - I would of liked to document the code a bit better, as well as identify spesific id's rather then using classes. 🙂
