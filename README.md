 User Story: 
 
      └── The following is a critical user journey for ClearScore customers:
             Test 1
                Using your tooling of choice, visit the ClearScore website & write tests to check that:
                • the “We use cookies” notification is present
                • the “We use cookies” notification can be dismissed
                • the “We use cookies” notification does not reappear after being dismissed
                • the appropriate cookie(s) are set
                
             Test 3
                Using your FE framework from Test 1, provide tests to address the following acceptance criteria:
                • an email address is required to sign up
                • a valid email address must be provided to sign up
                • when a valid email address is provided, and Sign up is clicked, the user is taken to step 1 of registration
             

- I have decided to include an aditional test called (Test 3.1) focused on registration functionality.
